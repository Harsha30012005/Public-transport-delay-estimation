# Public Transport Delay Estimation Using Video Analytics and Vision Transformers

## üìñ Abstract
Public transport delays caused by traffic, signals, and passenger boarding reduce reliability. Existing GPS-based systems give rough estimates but lack accuracy and clarity. This project proposes a deep learning framework that fuses video analytics, GPS, and schedule data for real-time bus delay prediction. CNNs and Vision Transformers process video to detect congestion, signals, and crowding, while sequence models estimate delays. The system provides explainable predictions, a passenger app with live alerts, and multi-objective outputs like waiting time and reliability. Future scope includes scaling citywide and integrating external factors for smarter transit planning.

## üöß Problem Statement
Public bus services often experience unpredictable delays due to traffic congestion, signal wait times, passenger boarding dynamics, and external factors such as weather and events. Current prediction methods, primarily based on GPS traces or schedule data, or using standard statistical and machine-learning models, fall short in several key respects:

1. They often provide coarse delay estimates without identifying the primary causes behind delays.  
2. They lack real-time responsiveness or adaptability to rapidly changing conditions.  
3. They typically target a single output delay rather than multiple performance metrics relevant to both passengers and transit authorities (e.g., reliability, passenger wait time, downstream impacts).

## üîç Existing Solutions and Limitations

| Existing System | Method Used | Limitation |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| **DeepTTE (AAAI 2018)** | Deep neural network on GPS trajectories | Ignores video data and lacks explainability |
| **Deep Learning on Heterogeneous Datasets** | Combines GPS, schedules, categorical data | No fine-grained visual insight into delays |
| **Embedding + Wide & Deep Models (MDPI 2020)** | Combines categorical + continuous features with attention | Some interpretability, no video analytics |
| **IoT + Neural Network Systems** | Predicts using GPS + schedule data | Limited to tabular data; no visual context |
| **Partitioned Sequence Models (DA-RNN, PMLNet)** | Divides travel into stages | Improved accuracy, but no visual reasoning |

## ‚ùó Gaps Identified
1. **Lack of Video Analytics:** Existing systems overlook visual cues such as congestion, passenger crowding, and signal states.  
2. **Limited Explainability:** Current models don‚Äôt quantify which factor (traffic, boarding, signals) caused a delay.  
3. **Single-Objective Focus:** Most predict only travel time, ignoring reliability or downstream effects.  
4. **Weak Real-Time Integration:** Systems rarely offer continuous updates or verifiable evidence of delays.  
5. **External Context Underuse:** Weather, events, and disruptions are not integrated into models.

## üöÄ Proposed Work

### 1. Video Analytics for Delay Factors  
- Use CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViTs) to analyze live or recorded camera feeds.  
- Detect congestion, signal states, and boarding events.  

### 2. Spatio-Temporal Delay Prediction  
- Fuse video, GPS, and schedule data using RNNs or Transformers.  
- Learn delay patterns in real time.  

### 3. Explainable AI (XAI) Module  
- Apply SHAP, Grad-CAM, and attention visualization to interpret model predictions.  
- Show factor contributions (e.g., 60% traffic, 30% signal, 10% boarding).  

### 4. Multi-Objective Real-Time Output  
- Predict multiple outputs: delay, reliability score, waiting time, ripple effects.  
- Update passengers and control centers continuously.  

### 5. Automated Photo Proof Sharing  
- Capture and share geo-tagged, time-stamped images during abnormal delays as verifiable proof for authorities.
